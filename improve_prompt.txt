the claude-code-permissions-hook is a mature hook for claude, but we have been logging passthrough commands to a file, so we can make improvements if needed. Nonetheless, we occassionally need to read the passthrough commands and make an assessment. Today is one of those assessment periods.

(1) read and categorize the commands found in /tmp/claude-passthrough.json; I use `jq . /tmp/claude-passthrough.json | grep command` but you may want more details
(2) evaluate if all of the passthroughs legitimate and expected
(3) Provide a report of the types of commands in the file, make a table of the types of commands, grouped by type
(4) if there are commands that should outright be allowed or denied  see if we can improve our code or .toml file. /read-repo-rules /parallel-plan /dispatching-parallel-agents /subagent-driven-development
